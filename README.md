"# Revenge-of-the-Marshmallow---II" 

 ---- **Revenge of the Marshmallow 2** ----

It's a game made just for fun and to relearn what I've 
forgotten about Java language. Also to improve object oriented
thinking and to practice some game programming techniques 
(have lately become interested in making games). Am also 
learning game dev in C# with Unity like normal people but 
wanted to use something less conventional. Perhaps when I 
finish the basic concept using Java, and when I've gotten more 
used to Unity, I'm going to rewrite and update the game in 
Unity (Revenge of the Marshmallow 3).

It's probably not going to be anything big but I guess it's a 
decent showcase of my oop skills.

The story is about a Marshmallow whose friends were eaten by 
human race. The player can pick between different races to 
fight for in the final version. This one (version 2) focuses 
just on this one Marshmallow.
